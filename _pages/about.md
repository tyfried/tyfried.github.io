* I am a Mathematics Teacher at Coconino Community College in Flagstaff, AZ.
* In my free time, I am currently designing a repository of contextual information.  So far this has involved studying how Wikipedia works, learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)...and occasionally attempting to determine the nature of truth.  Click [here](/portfolio/sunesiary) for more info.  I am hoping to transition this work to full-time graduate study in Fall 2019.
* I started my own (tutoring business)[http://www.flgmathtutor.net] in Flagstaff.
* I am a member of Coconino County's (Search and Rescue)[http://coconinosar.org] volunteer unit.
