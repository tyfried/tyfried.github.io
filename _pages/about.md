* I am currently designing a crowdsourcing website for understanding complex, controversial topics.  So far this has involved studying how peer production communities (e.g. Wikipedia) operate, teaching myself full-stack web development, and occasionally attempting to determine the nature of truth.  I started in the fall of 2017, and officially [launched](https://www.idealogs.org) on September 1st, 2019.  Click [here](/portfolio/idealogs) for more info.
* From December 2017 to August 2019, I was an adjunct lecturer in mathematics at [Coconino Community College](https://www.coconino.edu) in Flagstaff, AZ. I am currently in the process of moving to Chicago to pursue some new opportunities.
* I started my own [tutoring business](http://www.flgmathtutor.net) in Flagstaff.
* I am a member of Coconino County's [Search and Rescue](http://coconinosar.org) volunteer unit.
