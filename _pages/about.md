* I am currently developing a crowdsourcing website for understanding complex, controversial topics.  So far this has involved studying how peer production communities (e.g. Wikipedia) operate, teaching myself full-stack web development, and occasionally attempting to determine the nature of truth. Click [here](/portfolio/idealogs) for more info.
* From January 2018 to August 2019, I was an adjunct lecturer of mathematics at [Coconino Community College](https://www.coconino.edu) in Flagstaff, AZ. I am moving to Chicago in September to pursue some new opportunities.
* I started my own [tutoring business](http://www.flgmathtutor.net) in Flagstaff.
* I was a member of Coconino County's [Search and Rescue](http://coconinosar.org) volunteer unit.
