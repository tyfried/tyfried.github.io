* I am a Mathematics Instructor at Coconino Community College in Flagstaff, AZ.
* In my free time, I am currently designing a novel reference work for understanding controversial topics.  So far this has involved studying how Wikipedia's community operates, learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), and occasionally attempting to determine the nature of truth.  I have a prototype available at [www.sunesiary.org](https://www.sunesiary.org), and a [proposal](http://tyfried.github.io/files/discourse.pdf) for transitioning this work to graduate study in Fall 2019.  Click [here](/portfolio/sunesiary) for more info.  
* I started my own [tutoring business](http://www.flgmathtutor.net) in Flagstaff.
* I am a member of Coconino County's [Search and Rescue](http://coconinosar.org) volunteer unit.
