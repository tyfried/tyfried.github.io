Sunesiary adapts a wiki towards a novel model for aggregating and refining contextual information.  The goal is to provide a neutral, trusted repository of context for helping to break down and understand controversial topics.  I have developed a [proposal](http://tyfried.github.io/files/discourse.pdf) for future study of this work in graduate school.  A proof-of-concept is available at [www.sunesiary.org](https://www.sunesiary.org).
