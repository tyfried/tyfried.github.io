Sunesiary adapts a wiki towards a novel model for aggregating and refining contextual information.  The goal is to provide a neutral, trusted repository of context for helping to break down and understand controversial topics.  I have developed a [proposal](http://tyfried.github.io/files/discourse.pdf) for future study of this work in graduate school.  A proof-of-concept is available at [www.sunesiary.org](https://www.sunesiary.org).

## Motivation
The state of public discourse is unhealthy at best.  Some examples:
* The journalism industry is [under](https://issues.org/journalism-under-attack/) [siege](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/world/americas/journalists-killed.html).
* A [recent analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02934-x) of how true and false news spreads on Twitter found that not only did falsehoods spread more widely and at a faster rate than the truth, but that it was humans, not robots, who were more likely to spread it.
* A nontrivial percentage of peer-reviewed, quantitative research findings appear to be [false as well](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124).[^1]


<!-- ; it is also increasingly shifting towards mediums which do not support [rational argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) -->

[^1]: Credit to the Community Data Science Collective, I first learned about this issue on their [blog](https://blog.communitydata.cc/a-proposal-to-mitigate-false-discovery-in-cscw-research/).

In each of these crises, I see an opportunity for an unbiased collection of contextual information to make a difference: for the news industry, a vehicle to showcase quality journalism; for social media, a home for more nuanced discussions in search of truth; and for academia, a place for the digestion of intricate concepts. What I am suggesting is not a replacement for these mediums, but rather a mechanism for placing them in their proper context.

## Model
I believe that all contextual information can roughly be categorized as
* **writings**, the creative work that we produce to try to make sense of the world;
* **statements**, the subsequent claims we derive from these writings; and
* **questions**, the unknowns arising when two or more of these statements directly contradict.

These three categories reinforce each other: writings argue towards particular statements, contradicting statements suggest a particular question, and unanswered questions inspire new writings.  Together, they form a cycle (see above) which captures how complex ideas evolve within communities of inquiry.

## Sunesiary

[Sunesiary](https://www.sunesiary.org) is a project that take this model and applies to it principles of [peer production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production) in order to understand controversial topics.
