Sunesiary adapts a wiki towards a novel model for aggregating and refining contextual discourse.  The mission is to provide a neutral, trusted repository of context.  I have developed a [proposal](http://tyfried.github.io/files/discourse.pdf) for future study of this work in graduate school.  Visit [www.sunesiary.org](https://www.sunesiary.org) to see a prototype.
