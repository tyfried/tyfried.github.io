Coding theory was invented to facilitate reliable transition of information over noisy networks.  One challenge in coding theory is determining the maximum number of codewords in a given code.  This number is known as a bound.  This report explores notable bounds, and then a special class of codes that meet the Gilbert bound.  You can view the report [here](http://tyfried.github.io/files/bounds.pdf).
