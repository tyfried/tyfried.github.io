Coding theory was invented to facilitate reliable transition of information over noisy networks.  One challenge in this field is determining the maximum number of codewords in a given code; this number is known as a _bound_.  As part of an independent study project for MATH 567, Introduction to Coding Theory, I explored a few notable bounds as well as a special class of codes that meet the Gilbert bound.
