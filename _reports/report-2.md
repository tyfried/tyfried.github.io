During the summer of 2012 I studied the spectrum of self-adjoint Toeplitz matrices under the direction of [Alejandro Uribe](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~uribe/) in an [REU](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/research/research-experience-for-undergraduates--reu-/recent-reu-projects.html) at the University of Michigan's Department of Mathematics.  I proved the Szego Limit Theorem for a very specific type of Berezin-Toeplitz operator, and made a conjecture for more general symbols.
